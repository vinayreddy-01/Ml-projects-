# Movie Recommendation System (Content-Based Filtering)
## Project Overview
This project implements a content-based movie recommendation system that suggests movies to users based on the features of the movies they have liked. The system leverages the metadata of movies, such as genre, cast, and plot descriptions, to recommend similar films.

## Features
## Content-Based Filtering: Recommends movies by comparing the features (like genre, actors, directors) of previously liked movies with other movies in the dataset.
- Similarity Calculation: Uses techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and Cosine Similarity to find the similarity between movies.
- Metadata Focus: Recommendations are based on movie metadata, making it independent of user ratings.
## Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
## Libraries:
- Pandas, NumPy (for data manipulation)
- Scikit-learn (for TF-IDF vectorization and similarity calculations)
- NLTK (for text preprocessing)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data visualization)
